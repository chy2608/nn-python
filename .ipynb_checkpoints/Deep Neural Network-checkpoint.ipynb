    "# Using Python to Create a Deep Neural Network from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This personal project aims to build a deep neural network from scratch using only python and numpy libraries. The goal of this project is to serve as a self-exercise into the field of machine learning to help myself understand the workings of a multi-layer perceptron better, and so the project begins with the mathematical side of DNN, such as forward and backpropogation. Further on in the project, multiprocessing is also employed to optimise runtimes, allowing the computer to calculate gradients for different instances at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematics of DNN\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of a DNN\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a deep neural network consists of one input layer, a series of hidden layers, and one output layer. Each layer consists of numerous nodes, each node connecting to every other node in the previous and next layer. This allows for the formation of complex relationships between each node and thus extending to the entire network, allowing for it to \"learn\" patterns in data. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./img/DNN.jpg\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above figure, we have a DNN with an architecture of 3-3-3-2:  3 input nodes, 2 hidden layers with 3 nodes each, and 2 output nodes. Each node has a corresponding layer number, $l$, and its position within the layer $j$, both of which follows zero-based indexing. With this, we can denote a node using $\\nu^{(l)}_j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Weights and Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "The intricate relationships that form between each node and layer and subsequently the entire network is based on the fact that each node's value is a linear combination of the values of every node of the previous layer. The coefficients of the values of the nodes of the previous layer are known as weights, and can be represented by the lines connecting the nodes in the above figure. For some node $\\nu^{(l)}_j$, and a node in the previous layer $\\nu^{(l-1)}_k$, we denote the weight connecting these two nodes to be $w^{(l)}_{jk}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./img/Weights.jpg\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, each node $\\nu^{(l)}_j$ also has a \"bias\" term corresponding to it, denoted as $b^{(l)}_j$, and so the value associated with each node $a^{(l)}_j$ is given by the sum\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "a^{(l)}_j = \\sigma \\left(\\sum_{k = 0}^{N(l-1)-1}w^{(l)}_{jk}\\cdot a^{(l-1)}_k + b^{(l)}_j\\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N(l-1)$ is the number of nodes in the layer $l-1$. Note that in front, there appears a function $\\sigma$ that wraps around the entire calculation. This is known as an activation function which processes the \"pure\" value of the node (the linear combination + bias) into an \"activated\" value. From now on, we denote the \"pure\" value of a node to be $z^{(l)}_j$ and its \"activated\" value to be $a^{(l)}_j$. Hence, we can see that the value of a node (both pure or activated) depends on the _activated_ values of the previous nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "If all node values were kept as its \"pure\" value $z^{(l)}_j$, we would only ever have linear relationships between each node, and that would cause the neural network to be mathematically equivalent to having no hidden layers at all, and the network would only ever be able to learn linear patterns. However, in real life, many patterns are more complex than linear relationships, and so by passing the \"pure\" value through a non-linear function, we can allow the DNN to learn non-linear patterns. There are many activation functions, each suited for a different purpose. Some activation functions depend only on the $z^{(l)}_j$ of the node in question, such as the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "a^{(l)}_j = \\sigma \\left( z^{(l)}_j \\right) = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "z^{(l)}_j, &z^{(l)}_j > 0 \\\\ \n",
    "0, &z^{(l)}_j \\leq 0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas some other activation functions depend on the $z^{(l)}_k$ of all nodes in the layer, such as the Softmax activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "a^{(l)}_j = \\sigma \\left( z^{(l)}_j \\right) =  \\frac{\\exp{z^{(l)}_j}}{\\sum_{k = 0}^{N(l)-1}\\exp{z^{(l)}_k}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Propagation and Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "For a specific set of input values, we can use the above equation to calculate the values of every node in the next layer, and using those values, calculate the values of the next layer so on and so forth, until we _propagate_ and calculate the values of the output layer. This process is known as forward propagation. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the training process, multiple pairs of inputs and labels (correct \"answers\") are used. For each pair, we pass the inputs through the DNN, and using forward propagation, we return with some outputs (predicted \"answers\") $a^{(L_f)}_j$ ($L_f$ is the final/output layer). We then compare the correct values $y_j$ and predicted values $a^{(L_f)}_j$, and measure how far off we are, or how wrong we are. To mathematically encapsulate the idea of \"wrongness\", we use what we call a Loss function $L(y_j, a^{(L_f)}_j)$. Using this Loss function, it tells us how far off we are from the correct answer, and depending on it, we can adjust the values of the weights and biases and try a different pair again. By repeating this process, we essentially end up tuning our DNN to be able to recognise the patterns of the input and output pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the Loss function encapsulates \"wrongness\" depends on the type of Loss function itself. For example, in regression, squared loss is a common loss function, where we measure the total magnitude of the differences between the predicted and true values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "L = \\sum_{j = 0}^{N(L_f)-1}\\left(y_j - a^{(L_f)}_j\\right)^2\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another loss function is known as Categorical Cross-Entropy, and is commonly used in cases where the output is separated into discrete classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "L = \\sum_{j = 0}^{N(L_f)-1}\\left(-y_j \\cdot \\log a^{(L_f)}_j\\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of loss functions, each suited for a different class of problems. There is no one-size-fits-all type of loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Backpropagation \n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation refers to the process where the loss function is used to tune the weights and biases of the model to improve it. If we can find how a change in the weights/biases affects the loss (\"wrongness\"), we can update the weights and biases according to that to decrease the loss. How a change in the weights/biases affects the loss is exactly the derivative (more accurately, the partial derivative) of loss w.r.t the weights and biases:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w^{(l)}_{jk}} \\qquad \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b^{(l)}_j}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From multivariable calculus, we can use these partial derivatives to form a gradient vector field $\\nabla L$, which, for any input in the input space (in this case, a vector of all parameters $\\textbf{p}$) returns a vector of steepest ascent up the loss function. Hence, to minimise the loss function, we must move in the opposite direction to said vector, namely $-\\nabla L$ with some step-size $r$ known as the learning rate. So, we can form two equations that tell us how to update the $i$-th iteration weights and biases:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\textbf w_{i+1} &= \\textbf w_i - r\\nabla L_w \\\\ \n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nabla L_w$ and $\\nabla L_b$ are the gradients for updating the weights and biases respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./img/Partial w.jpg\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by looking at the equation $\\partial L/\\partial w^{(1)}_{00}$. From the above figure, we can see that the only value which is dependent on $w^{(1)}_{00}$ is $a^{(1)}_{0}$, which in turn depends on $z^{(1)}_{0}$. Using the chain rule, we can rewrite it as follows:\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with the total derivative, $dL$. Note that $a^{(1)}_{0}$ is used in the calculation of all three nodes in $l = 2$, so we must take into account $a^{(2)}_{i} (i = 0, 1, 2)$\n",

We must be careful here, in that $a^{(2)}_i$, depending on what activation function we use, can depend on multiple $z^{(2)}$, such as in the case of Softmax, and so similar to how we calculated $dL$, we first find $da^{(2)}_i$ and then $\\partial a^{(2)}_i /\\partial a^{(1)}_0$, and we get:\n",

    "\n",
    "The setup of the DNN begins with initialising the model architecture. In this step, we feed the model information about the number of inputs, the loss function, and also the hidden and output layers, each with information about the number of nodes and activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Construction\n",

    "    2. Workers are setup for multiprocessing further on.\n",
    "    3. For each epoch, the model splits the dataset into batches. The model loops over each batch, sending each data instance into a different processor.\n",
    "       1. Within each worker, the input nodes are fed the input values of that data instance. Forward propagation is then carried out throughout the rest of the network.\n",
    "       2. Recursive sum is then calculated, back propogating throughout the network and gradient vector is calculated.\n",
    "       3. Worker ejects the gradient adds to a shared gradient vector\n",
    "    4. The average of all gradient vectors is calculated and used to update the parameters\n",

    "### Storing parameters and node/layer information\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to store the weights and biases, two seperate 1-D numpy arrays are created. Taking the 3-3-3-2 architecture as an example, this means that the weight array is a 1-D array of size 24, and the bias array is a 1-D array of size 8.\n",

Practically, the filler can take on anything, such as a null value.\n",

To access $b^{(l)}_j$, take the $l$-th index of the starting index array then simply add $j$.

    "#### Fitting Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"Model\" class, we define a main parent function `Fit`, which calls the other calculation functions defined above. It first begins with splitting up the passed data set into a training and validation set, and initialises any optimisers (e.g. Adam, RMSProp) as well as the multiprocessing workers and the queues needed. The function then loops through every epoch. Within each epoch, the batches are split, and a \"start\" command is passed to each worker. For every instance in the batch, it is passed through to the input queue, followed by a \"wait\" command. The gradients for each instance is then siphoned out of the output queue and added to a running total gradient array, which after all instances are done calculating, the average gradient is calculated and used to update the parameters. \n",

    "It is then here the workers are restarted, and used to forward propagate the network using the various inputs in the validation set to calculate validation loss and accuracy. The calculations for the current batch is then over, and the process repeats for the next batch. \n",

By going through the mathematics of forward and backpropagation, gradient descent, as well as how different activation functions work and the concept of optimisers, it allowed me to really grasp the idea of how these processes worked together to \"train\" and allow the machine to \"learn\". By getting hands-on with Python and implementing the mathematics, I could better understand and appreciate the steps it took to train a model, especially how mini-batch gradient descent reduced training times by moving down the slope more frequently, albeit less accurately at times. This project was also very much object-oriented, which is something I have seldom worked with before. By creating all these `Node` and `Layer` objects and the main `Model` class, I have become much more comfortable with OOP, and understand its benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many versions of the model and slight tweaks which did not make it to this final Jupyter Notebook, so I would like to document some of the major changes I made here, to serve as a log of the things I have learnt:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Backpropagation mistake\n",
    "\n",
    "Early on, when first going through the mathematics of backpropagation, I assumed ReLU activations for every hidden layer due to the simplicity of the ReLU function, where its derivatives are either 1 or 0, based on the $z^{(l)}_j$ value of the corresponding node, and so the backpropagations were carried out with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial a^{(l+1)}_i}{\\partial a^{(l)}_j} = \\frac{\\partial a^{(l+1)}_i}{\\partial z^{(l+1)}_i}\\frac{\\partial z^{(l+1)}_i}{\\partial a^{(l)}_j} =  \\frac{\\partial a^{(l+1)}_i}{\\partial z^{(l+1)}_i}w^{(l+1)}_{ij} \\qquad\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is true for ReLU, as the activation only depends on its own node. However, when introducing Softmax, where its activation depends on the $z$ of all other nodes in the layer, the equation above is incorrect, and so was replaced with the correct version:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial a^{(l+1)}_i}{\\partial a^{(l)}_j} = \\sum^{N(l+1)-1}_{h = 0} \\frac{\\partial a^{(l+1)}_i}{\\partial z^{(l+1)}_h}\\frac{\\partial z^{(l+1)}_h}{\\partial a^{(l)}_j} =  \\sum^{N(l+1)-1}_{h = 0} \\frac{\\partial a^{(l+1)}_i}{\\partial z^{(l+1)}_h}w^{(l+1)}_{hj}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Numerical stability of Softmax\n",
    "The normal softmax functions include taking the natural exponent of the $z$ values. When combined with ReLU activation functions in the previous layers, I ran into an overflow error. This is due to the fact that the Softmax function is attempting to take the natural exponent of numbers in the order of magnitude $10^3$. To counter this, a numerically stable version of Softmax is applied, where all the exponents ($z$ values) of the layer had $m=\\max {\\textbf z}$ subtracted from them:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\text{Softmax}(z^{(l)}_i) = \\frac{e^{-m}}{e^{-m}} \\cdot \\frac{e^{z^{(l)}_i}}{\\sum_{k=0}^{N(l)-1}e^{z^{(l)}_k}} = \\frac{e^{z^{(l)}_i-m}}{\\sum_{k=0}^{N(l)-1}e^{z^{(l)}_k-m}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensured that the exponents will not be so large such that python will not be able to handle the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parameter Initialisation\n",
    "At first, the weights were randomly normalised between -1 and 1. However, this soon proved to be a poor choice of initialisation as the two ReLU layers quickly caused the activations to skyrocket, which rendered the Softmax layer useless, as the variance of the values were so large the Softmax function outputted 0 and 1 instead of softer percentages, essentially reducing it to an ArgMax function. However, for ReLU layers, a well-documented initialisation method exists, which is the He or Kaiming Initialisation, as mentioned in the notebook. This allowed the model to train with more controlled values, and the Softmax was able to convert the final output layer's activations into a much more \"softer\" set of values. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Iterating through a pandas dataframe\n",
    "In one of the earliest versions of the model, to calculate the gradient for each data instance in a mini-batch, the `Fit` function iterated through each row of the training data pandas dataframe using the `pandas.DataFrame.iterrows()` function. However, after profiling the code, it seemed that a majority of the runtime was spent executing the `iterrows()` function. Hence, the `Fit` function was changed such that the training dataframe was converted into a numpy array as soon as the `Fit` function was called. Instead of iterating each row of the dataframe, the mini-batch was looped over using a index-based for-loop on a numpy array. This halved the runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Vectorising\n",
    "Another optimisation made was converting lists into 1-D numpy arrays. In first version of the model, the weights were stored as a list, where each element of the list was a 2-D numpy array of shape $(N(l), N(l-1))$. This made it easy to index the parameters, as the indexes were the same as the mathematical indices. However, by flattening the parameters into a 1-D numpy array, it saved a lot of processing time to index the elements, but also made calculations with the weights much more optimised. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Multiprocessing \n",
    "The first versions of multiprocessing included creating new workers every training sample in the batch, and shutting down the workers after each sample in the batch. However, this proved to be extremely slow, as creating the overheads and shutting down the workers took a significant amount of time. Hence, the final version has the workers set up at the start of the entire training session, and only shuts down after the model has finished training fully. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the worker is designed to constantly siphon data from the feed-in/input queue and a while loop is used to siphon items out of the output queue, the workers need to be able to stop grabbing items from the input queue and output a \"finished\" signal to the output queue so that the output queue's while loop knows when to break. This inspired the \"waiting\" mechanism. Essentially, when the worker is fed a \"wait\" signal, it stops siphoning from the input queue, and spits a \"finished\" message to the output queue. When all workers are \"finished\" for the batch, the output queue while loop breaks, and the gradient descent process can continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, an issue still remains is that the `.get()` method of the output queue is considerably slow, around 0.01 seconds for each item if not more. For a batch with 128 samples, siphoning items from the multiprocessing queue will take 1.28 seconds. From the console alone, we can see that this accounts for around 85% of the training time for each batch, which is not ideal. However, it is still astronomically faster than calculating each sample one by one in the case of monoprocessing.  \n"
